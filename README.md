## TASK DESCRIPTION

Compiler design is an important subject in computer science that deals with the theory and practice of developing compilers. A compiler is a system software that translates a program written in a high-level programming language into machine code that can be executed by a computer. Since computers understand only machine-level instructions, compilers play a crucial role in bridging the gap between human-readable programming languages and hardware execution.

A well-designed compiler not only translates the source code correctly but also ensures that the generated code is efficient and optimized. Compiler design combines concepts from programming languages, data structures, algorithms, and computer architecture. Understanding compiler design basics helps programmers write better code and gives insight into how errors are detected and handled during program execution.

## PHASES OF A COMPILER

A compiler works in multiple phases, each responsible for a specific task in the translation process.

### 1. Lexical Analysis

Lexical analysis is the first phase of a compiler. It scans the source code and converts it into a sequence of tokens. Tokens represent keywords, identifiers, operators, literals, and symbols. The lexical analyzer removes comments and white spaces and reports lexical errors if any invalid tokens are found.

### 2. Syntax Analysis

Syntax analysis checks whether the sequence of tokens follows the grammatical rules of the programming language. This phase constructs a parse tree or syntax tree to represent the structure of the program. Syntax errors such as missing semicolons or unmatched brackets are detected during this phase.

### 3. Semantic Analysis

Semantic analysis verifies the meaning of the program. It ensures that variables are declared before use, data types are compatible, and operations are semantically valid. This phase helps in detecting logical errors related to scope and type checking.

### 4. Intermediate Code Generation

In this phase, the compiler generates an intermediate representation of the source code. This representation is independent of the target machine and helps in simplifying the code optimization and final code generation processes.

### 5. Code Optimization

Code optimization improves the performance of the intermediate code without changing its meaning. Optimizations may include removing redundant code, improving loop efficiency, and reducing memory usage.

### 6. Code Generation

The final phase of the compiler converts the optimized intermediate code into target machine code or assembly code. The generated code is then ready for execution by the computer.

## SYMBOL TABLE AND ERROR HANDLING

The symbol table is an important data structure used by the compiler to store information about variables, functions, and identifiers. Error handling mechanisms allow the compiler to detect, report, and recover from errors during compilation.
